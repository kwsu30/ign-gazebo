  /// \brief A plugin for trivial audio detection.
  ///
  /// Multiple audio sources and microphones can be created.
  /// After each simulation step, microphones check if audio
  /// was detected by any sources in the world.
  /// No audio is actually played to an audio device
  /// such as speakers - this plugin is meant to check if audio
  /// could theoretically be heard at a certain location or not.
  ///
  /// This system processes the following SDF parameters:
  ///
  /// <b><audiosource></b> A new audiosource in the environment, which has the
  ///   following child elements:
  /// \par
  /// <b><audiosource><id></b> The source ID, which must be >= 0.\n
  /// <b><audiosource><position></b> The position, expressed as "x y z".
  ///   Each position coordinate must be separated by whitespace.\n
  /// <b><audiosource><attenuationfunction></b> The attenuation function.
  ///   See logical_audio::AttenuationFunction for a list of valid attenuation
  ///   functions, and logical_audio::Source::SetAttenuationFunction() for how
  ///   to specify an attenuation function in SDF.\n
  /// <b><audiosource><attenuationshape></b> The attenuation shape.
  ///   Currently, the only valid value is "sphere".\n
  /// <b><audiosource><innerradius></b> The inner radius of the attenuation
  ///   shape. This value must be >= 0.0.
  ///   The volume of the source will be <em><audiosource><volume></em> at
  ///   locations that have a distance <= inner radius from the source.\n
  /// <b><audiosource><falloffdistance></b> The falloff distance.
  ///   This value must be greater than the value for
  ///   <em><audiosource><innerradius></em>.
  ///   This defines the distance from the audio source where the volume is 0.\n
  /// <b><audiosource><volumelevel></b> The volume level emitted from the
  ///   source.
  ///   This must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 (representing 0% to 100%).\n
  /// <b><audiosource><playing></b> Whether the source should play
  ///   immediately or not.
  ///   Use \p true to initiate audio immediately, and \p false otherwise.\n
  /// <b><audiosource><playduration></b> The duration (in seconds) audio
  ///   is played from the source.
  ///   This value must be >= 0.
  ///   A value of 0 means that the source will play for an infinite
  ///   amount of time.
  ///
  /// <b><microphone></b> A new microphone in the environment,
  ///   which has the following child elements:
  /// \par
  /// <b><microphone><id></b> The microphone ID, which must be >= 0.\n
  /// <b><microphone><position></b> The position, expressed as "x y z".
  ///   Each position coordinate must be separated by whitespace.\n
  /// <b><microphone><volumedetectionthreshold></b> The minimum volume level
  ///   the microphone can detect.
  ///   This must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 (representing 0% to 100%).
